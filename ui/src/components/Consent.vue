          ><br />
          The purpose of this research is to evaluate the quality of synthetic
          audio clips generated using an artificial neural network. The audio
          clips under test belong to the domain of audio textures (for e.g. the
          sound made by water filling a container or that of wind blowing) or
          pitches made by musical instruments. The specific goal of this project
          is to ensure that the synthetic outputs generated by these deep
          learning models are validated by human beings to test for certain
          sound qualities such as smoothness or morph.</span
